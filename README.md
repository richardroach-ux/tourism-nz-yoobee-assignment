# Tourism-NZ-Yoobee-Assignment
Assignment work for Yoobee Colleges; first foray into React

🔮 - The brief was to create a single-page application using the JavaScript library of our choice; as well as a third-party plugin.
I chose React.js - <a>https://reactjs.org/</a> for my library and TypeIt - <a>https://www.typeitjs.com/</a> to extend the app aesthetically.

🏅 - The goal was to create a booking system allowing users to input travel details - start and end dates, number of people travelling - and receive accommodation options based off their input.

👨‍🏫 - Project involved treating this as an exercise in project management, with both internal and external proposals created before coding began.

🤔 - Ultimately, some functionality is lacking due to time constraints as well as my inexperience with React, but it has given me a much better view of how React as well as vanilla JS works.
Also, I think my states may be in worse shape than 'the' States. 😅
Annnnnnd, it isn't responsive, not in the slightest. View at widths below 1920px at your peril.
